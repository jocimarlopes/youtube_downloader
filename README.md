# Youtube MP3 Bot Downloader

I was having problems to download MP3 from web, until I saw that it was a repetitive movement, so I decided to automate it.
Currently we just need the Youtube Video Links (how many do you want).

# Make sure you have installed
- Python 3.6 or lastest - here: https://python.org/ 

# How to use

- Go inside the project folder
- At the command prompt you type **`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`**
- Now we just open the archive **`bot.py`** with a code editor (nodepad, nano, vscode, vim) and add the Youtube Links inside the Array called **list_musics[]** and save the code.
- After the installation and configuration is finished, just run in command prompt **`python bot.py`** and download movies.

## Important
**SAY NO TO PIRACY, THIS BOT IS USED FOR STUDY PURPOSES, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MISUSE.**
